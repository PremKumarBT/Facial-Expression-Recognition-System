# Facial-Expression-Recognition-System
Created a deep learning model from CNN capable of recognizing and classifying facial expressions such as happiness, sad, anger, fear,disgust, neutral, and surprise. The system processes live video input from the camera and provides emotion predictions in real time. It was trained using a widely known facial expression recognition dataset.

To test or try the project need to have python 3.10.9 and use VS Code editor.

Need to Download all the nessary Modules and packages CV2 and FER inorder to run properly.

The output will be in the form of live video which is captured from camera and will be live reaction of angry, happiness, sad, fear, disgust, netural and surprise.
